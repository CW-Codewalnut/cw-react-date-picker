First off, thank you for considering contributing to our Date picker tool. It's people like you that make our project such a great tool.

## Getting Started

Before you begin:
- Have you read the code of conduct?
- Check out the existing issues!

### Contributions we are looking for

cw-react-date-picker is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code that can be incorporated into our project itself.

### Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation, or anything that needs improvement, we would love to hear about it! Just make sure that it is not already reported by searching on GitHub.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.

### Feature requests

You can add new features and thoughts to our Date picker tool, That helps a lot to enhance the features and use cases of our Date picker. 

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to [Your Project Name]? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues that should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g., implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

**Important:** By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add test cases.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints and coding practices.
5. Issue that pull request!
